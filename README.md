# Means of Production ----- a community-sourced tool library for those who want to get things done

## Register tools you own and make them available to your neighbors 
Add tool name, details, and even upload images of your tool.
============================================================
version 2 to include:
    -affordance to add links to tool manuals, safety guides, operating instructions, etc.
    -ability to add multiple photos --- including those of any hard copy resources owners may have
    -add "skill level" property
    -add tags for tool categories (e.g. hand tool, battery powered, gas, electric --- carpentry, plumbing, electrical --- etc...)
    -give tool owners the option to set "minimun cred required to borrow"
        --this is in response to common feedback/requests for some model for establishing trustworthiness in borrowers
        --a user can aquire "cred" by various interactions/contributions to the site 
            (e.g.
                registering their tools, 
                completing loans without issue, 
                contributing to other users' call for labor --- which refers to the implementation of a large "projects" feature, yet to come) 
        --then, tool owners have the option to set a min cred score required to borrow, say, nicer/more delicate tools


## Search tools and other workers in your local area
Find tools by their name or owner name
======================================
version 2 to include:
    -option to view results in a List view or Map view

## Manage Current Loans
Check the status and location of loaned out and borrowed tools
==============================================================
version 2 to include:
    -"due date" property that's auto-generated when a Loan is created
        -set up notifications for when due date approaches
        -give borrower/lender ability to modify due-date/extensions so long as both users agree
        -no "late fee" penalty mechanism as yet (not a priority at this time)
    -message/chat feature where borrower and user can communicate and arrange tool pick-up/drop off, and (potentially) due-date changes and return logistics
    -(contingent on map functionality) --- include something like GoogleRoutes feature that enables users to get directions to pick-up/return location without having to leave the site 

## View borrowing history
See which tools you're using most often --- perhaps it's time to make an investment.
See what tools are most borrowed in your area --- potentially identifying a shared community need.
