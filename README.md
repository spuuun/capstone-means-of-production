# CURRENTLY UNDERGOING RECONSTRUCTION

Version 2 was originally slated to include several feature upgrades and additions. However, recurring issues with certain dependencies continued to derail those efforts. Now, after some fiddling, testing, and weighing of options, I've decided to alter the course. 

Version 2 will now entail a project-wide refactor to replace error-prone dependencies, as well as a major overhaul to the UI and back-end architechture.

c.f. other existing branches, especially `master`, to review previous iterations of the source code.

Cheers!

# Means of Production - a community-sourced tool library for those who want to get things done

- #### Register tools you own and make them available to other users for checkout 
- #### Search tools and other workers in your local area
- #### View and manage your current loans

## Upcoming Features in Version 3:
- option to view results in a List view or Map view
- affordance to add links to tool manuals, safety guides, operating instructions, etc.
- ability to add multiple photos --- including those of any hard copy resources owners may have
- add "skill level" property
- add tags for tool categories (e.g. hand tool, battery powered, gas, electric --- carpentry, plumbing, electrical --- etc...)
- give tool owners the option to set "minimun cred required to borrow"
    - this is in response to common feedback/requests for some model for establishing trustworthiness in borrowers
    - a user can aquire "cred" by various interactions/contributions to the site 
        (e.g.
            registering their tools, 
            completing loans without issue, 
            contributing to other users' call for labor --- which refers to the implementation of a large "projects" feature, yet to come) 
    - then, tool owners have the option to set a min cred score required to borrow, say, nicer/more delicate tools

    - "due date" property that's auto-generated when a Loan is created
        - set up notifications for when due date approaches
        - give borrower/lender ability to modify due-date/extensions so long as both users agree
        - no "late fee" penalty mechanism as yet (not a priority at this time)
    - message/chat feature where borrower and user can communicate and arrange tool pick-up/drop off, and (potentially) due-date changes and return logistics
    - (contingent on map functionality) --- include something like GoogleRoutes feature that enables users to get directions to pick-up/return location without having to leave the site 
    - view your history
        - See which tools you're using most often --- perhaps it's time to make an investment.
        - See what tools are most borrowed in your area --- potentially identifying a shared community need.
